2014-07-13,"Besides looking at interest rates, take stock of the other charges levied by lenders to find the best deal Interest rates on home loans are the major differentiator between institutions that provide loans, no doubt. But there are other costs and fees involved during the process of taking a home loan. A clear understanding and comparison of these costs can help you choose between two loan providers offering similar interest rates. The mortgage deed charge (MOD) is a major charge among the various fees you have to cough up while taking a home loan. In general, most institutions charge 0.5 per cent of the loan amount as an MOD charge. So for a ₹50-lakh loan amount, the MOD charge will be ₹25,000. Some institutions market their home loan products by waiving this charge. A good saving? Beware, there is no such thing as a free lunch. There could be some hidden fees through which the institution will compensate for the waiver of this charge. For example, LIC Housing Finance does not charge an MOD. But it has much higher floating interest rate when compared to other loan providers. The floating interest rate it offers currently is over 11 per cent (for the first two years, the interest rate is fixed at 10.1 per cent) for home loans, which is much higher than most other institutions. Loan applications are subject to processing, such as verification of documents, before being sanctioned. A fee is charged for this process by all institutions. State Bank of India charges 0.25 per of the loan amount as a processing fee for loans up to ₹25 lakh and a fixed amount of ₹6,500 for loans above ₹25 lakh and up to ₹75 lakh. On the other hand, in the case of a loan taken from Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), the processing fee charged is up to 0.5 per cent of the loan amount. At ICICI Bank, the fee is relatively higher, at 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent of the loan amount. So, with an equal 10.15 per cent interest rate currently, SBI scores over ICICI Bank on this front. Some institutions may waive this processing fee. But such a waiver might only be secured after tough negotiations.In order to verify the legal status of the property that has been bought and for which the loan is sought, institutions appoint external lawyers. The fees for lawyers, too, are taken from the customer. However, if the property you are buying is approved in advance by any institution, this fee is not applicable. For instance, ICICI Bank and HDFC do not charge a legal fee if any project has been approved by them.Besides these major charges, there are others as well. These include registration fee, stamp duty and documentation charge. Get details of all applicable charges on a home loan from different institutions. Along with this, ask for the amortisation schedule. This table will detail your equated monthly instalments (EMI) and give a break-up of each month’s EMI between the principal and interest. For example, suppose you are taking a ₹50-lakh loan for a period of 20 years at an interest rate of 10.25 per cent. In this case, your EMI will be approximately ₹49,000. In the first month, about ₹6,300 will go toward the principal component and the remaining ₹42,700 will be your interest component. As the loan period progresses, the principal component will increase gradually while the interest component decreases. Summing up all the EMIs for the entire loan tenure will give the amount you will have to repay at the current interest rate.Now, sum up all the charges along with the EMI outflows to arrive at the total amount you will be paying at the current interest rate. Compare this amount across different institutions and go for the one that is the lowest. Remember though, the final value of your loan might differ from your calculation, as the interest rate varies over time.",http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/beyond-stocks/dont-compare-home-loans-on-interest-alone/article6206698.ece

HDFC Bank is planning to take a call on lowering its lending rates in certain retail products during the upcoming festive season, a senior official said.

“From a tactical point of view, we will respond to the market, remain competitive. If the market is moving in a certain direction, we will also remain competitive and I think that is something which we will rollout in the next few weeks,” HDFC Bank Executive Director Paresh Sukhtankar said.

He, however, did not disclose more details, saying, “I do not have anything to convey in a definitive manner.” 
ICICI Bank had last week announced lending rate cut up to 1 per cent in home loans. SBI has already announced rate cuts while the ICICI announcement was preceded by similar moves by others like Vijaya Bank.

Only SBI has cut its base rate while the other banks have gone for reducing their spreads in loan categories.

Paresh Sukhtankar said there are two dimensions to a call on cutting rates.

The first is the more structural driver of the movement of cost of funds which is determined by the deposit rates while the second, driven by competition, are tactical moves aimed at gaining market share and remaining competitive during a busy season.

During the last quarter, deposit rates have gone down by as much as 0.75 per cent, and there is little scope for them to go down further, he said.

On the base rate, Paresh Sukhtankar said it is dependent on the movement of the deposit rates and the credit policy initiatives to be announced by the Reserve Bank on October 30.

Like other banks, HDFC Bank will also take a call on the base rate during the quarter, he added.

“At sometime during the quarter, we certainly have to recalibrate the base rate,” he said. 
Paresh Sukhtankar, however, said HDFC Bank was among the earliest in passing on the benefits of the twin rounds of cash reserve ratio cut by the RBI and cut its base rate in the first quarter.

At 9.8 percent, he said the bank’s base rate is one of the most competitive in the system.

He said the bank’s credit growth, which came in at almost 23 per cent for the September quarter versus the overall banking system’s 16.6 per cent, will continue to outpace the systemic average by a few percentage points.

Demand from the retail segment is very good but the wholesale segment, which recorded a growth of under 15 per cent during the September quarter for the bank, is a laggard possibly due to gloomy economic conditions, he said.

Greenfield project loans demand is not coming and the corporate loan demand is driven more by the short-term working capital loan, he said.

For the 34th consecutive quarter, HDFC Bank had last week declared over 30 per cent spike in net profit at Rs 1,560 crore driven by health rise in retail advances and the resultant spike in interest come, even as its fee income remained almost flat during the second quarter.
