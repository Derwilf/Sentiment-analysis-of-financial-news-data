2011-04-18," HDFC SL ProGrowth Super II is a type-II unit-linked insurance plan (ULIP). Launched in September 2010, this is a small ticket-size scheme with multiple rider options and adequate death cover. It offers five investment options (funds) â€” one in each category of large-cap equity, mid-cap equity, balanced, debt and money market fund.        COST STRUCTURE        ProGrowth Super II is reasonably priced, with the premium allocation charge lower than most others in the category. However, the scheme's mortality charge is almost 60% that of LIC mortality table for those investing early in life. This charge reduces with age.        BENEFITS        Investors can choose a sum assured between 10-40 times the annualised premium. The plan also offers options such as accidental death benefits and critical health benefits on payment of an additional charge. The plan's settlement option allows policyholders to take away the fund value at maturity in periodic instalments over a period that may extend over 5 years. ProGrowth Super II has a 30-day free look-in period, during which it can return the policy if found unsuitable. Other companies offer a shorter review period of 15 days. PERFORMANCE: ProGrowth Super II does not have a big range of funds, but offers all required categories for investors to choose from as per their risk appetite. The funds in this scheme are new and most have not been able to prove their sheen yet. The mid-cap Opportunity Fund has been one of the top performers, having generated absolute gains of around 17.5% over the past 15 months, despite a lacklustre performance by mid-cap stocks. The Blue-chip Fund is a large-cap fund, but it has not been able to outperform its benchmark BSE 100. The performances of debtoriented Income Fund and Short-Term Fund have also not been encouraging.Overall, the funds basket does not look very attractive. But going by the good track record of HDFC Life fund returns, one can invest in them.        PORTFOLIO REVIEW        HDFC Life has always been heavily exposed to financial services and the oil and gas sectors. However, the fund manager, who had earlier reduced exposure in the banking sector, has again tilted the portfolio towards it. The fund manager has taken a contra call on the infotech sector by reducing exposure. The portfolio has been balanced out with sufficient exposure in growing, but lowbeta sectors such as FMCG and healthcare. Exposure of metals, a high-beta sector, in the portfolio is considerably low while sectors like automobiles have been almost written off by the fund manager.                   DEATH/MATURITY BENEFIT        Upon maturity, the policyholder receives the amount accumulated in the fund whereas in the case of death, a sum of both fund value and sum assured will be given. For instance, say a 35-year-old healthy male invests `20,000 pa in the Blue-chip Fund for 20 years. Assuming a sum assured equivalent to 40 times the annual premium, the total sum assured receivable, in the case of any eventuality, would be `8 lakh. By the end of 20 years, assuming a rate of return of 6% and 10%, the fund value shall be `5,11,487 and `8,26,837 respectively, receivable at maturity, along with a maturity bonus. However, in the case of demise of the policyholder, the nominee receives the sum assured of `8 lakh, along with the value of the fund then.        OUR VIEW        HDFC SL ProGrowth Super II is a fair deal for those looking for insuring themselves, as the death benefit that can be opted is high and that high death benefit accumulation of fund is extremely low. For high-risk return appetite investors, Opportunity Fund looks a good investment while low-risk profile investors can opt for the Income Fund.

2013-10-18,"MUMBAI: HDFC Bank continues to be the most expensive bank stock in the world though its price-to-book value has fallen from the peak levels achieved in the stock market boom of January 2008.  The Mumbai-based bank is valued at a P/BV of 4.27 at the current market price, down from 7.75 of January 2008 and from 5.31 in January this year. But this level is not only higher than all its peers in India, but also higher than the price/book value of the biggest banks in the world, Bloomberg data shows.  For instance, Citigroup's P/BV is 0.78, JP Morgan is 1.03, while Bank of America has a P/BV of 0.71. India's second-largest private sector lender also continues to maintain its premium over ICICI Bank, the largest private bank in the country, despite announcing its slowest quarterly profit growth in a decade on Tuesday. The difference between the price-to-book values of HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank changed to HDFC Bank's advantage at the end of trading on Thursday, the first day of full trading after Tuesday's results.  At 4.27, HDFC's P/BV was higher than Tuesday's 4.25, but lower than Monday's 4.35. ICICI Bank's P/BV was 1.62, down from Tuesday 1.64 compared with 1.67 the previous day. HDFC Bank's second quarter profit growth slowed to 27 per cent compared with 30 per cent in the previous quarters as the economic slowdown and high interest rates forced customers to cut back on borrowings and spending.
